                        There is a massive gulf between the behaviors that make
                        me successful at my job, and the behaviors that create
                        good art.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I work in technology, and the types skills that are
                        required to succeed are: contant multitasking, precise
                        and persistent communication, extremely logical
                        planning, and a love for deadlines. This is required to
                        maneuvre teams filled with dozens of people towards a
                        goal, where one person going off the rails can
                        potentially delay a project by weeks.

                        On the other hand, I feel that I'm most productive when
                        making video games if I allow myself to just go with the
                        first idea that pops in my head. I don't want to create
                        rigid plans, I want to create something cool. Working
                        alone, or with a small team, on a task where the only
                        metric of success is a vague sense of "fun" is
                        incredibly freeing. You can decide to add whatever
                        random thoughts come in your head, and you can remove
                        whatever you think sucks. My favorite part of indie
                        games is finding something that is completely stupid,
                        but you can tell the developer had a lot of fun putting
                        it in the game. Most indie games are full of this stuff
                        if you look for it! Hundreds of little things like that
                        add up to give each game its personality.

                        Meanwhile, the corporate world is notorious for its lack
                        of personality. The lack of autonomy makes personal
                        investment into a project you spend hundreds of hours
                        developing impossible. It is kind of depressing,
                        especially when you have to pull long hours, sacrificing
                        other parts of your life, for a project to not end up
                        how you wanted it to. Most of the time in my career, the
                        process of working on difficult projects made me feel
                        like I was constantly failing. If one piece doesn't work
                        as expected, some miscommunication happens, or there was
                        an error in estimates, suddenly you have management
                        breathing down your neck and you have to answer "tough
                        questions". Meanwhile, if you're lucky, the long hours
                        you spent will be rewarded with a celebratory dinner,
                        and a congrats message on Slack.

                        If it's not obvious, I'm going through a particularly
                        difficult time at work right now, which is making me
                        feel particularly incompetent. You know the deadlines
                        are arbitrary and too soon, and you know the scope is
                        too big, and you know you're balancing too many things
                        at once. Yet, you inevitably make a mistake, and you
                        feel like you let your team down... and suck as a person
                        in general.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is especially frustrating because long hours and
                        constantly stressful days can easily destroy your
                        motivation to do anything mildly difficult after work.
                        And creating good art generally requires a certain level
                        of frustration.

                        To me, game development represents both a sanctuary,
                        where I can escape from the overwhelming world, and hope
                        for a brighter future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The obvious brighter future is being able to follow your
                        dreams and make a living while doing it, but I also
                        think good games can make the world a slightly better
                        place. I have so many fond memories of playing games
                        with friends, and anything that people really connect
                        with can make them grow as a person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I always feel that the stories, characters, and
                        adventures I come to know from the media I consume
                        become a part of me in some way. I hope that someday, I
                        create something that resonates with people in a similar
                        way. Something that they had a great time experiencing,
                        or something that they learned from. Something that
                        makes them 1% happier or a 1% better person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would be so happy if I could spend my days on that
                        goal.
