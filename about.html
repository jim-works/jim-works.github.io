                    I haven't released anything notable yet, but I'm currently
                    working on a co-op zombie survivial game called "Undead,
                    Unearthed."

                    I'm a software engineer professionally, and got into
                    programming by creating video games when I was a kid. I've
                    always loved playing video games, solving difficult
                    problems, and creating things that others enjoy, so game
                    development is a perfect fit for me.
